It also greets the user upon activation, offering an interactive and personalized experience. Designed to streamline routine tasks, Jarvis aims to be a practical tool for daily efficiency, much like its fictional counterpart in *Iron Man*.
It can open desktop applications, fetch the data and perform Wikipedia and Google searches efficiently.
